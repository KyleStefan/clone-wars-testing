# Clone Wars · Session 03

**Clone a game everyone knows and make it yours: change how it looks, sounds and plays. You've got about 40 minutes.**

Today you clone a game inspired by Flappy Bird. You don't build it alone, and you don't build it one piece at a time. You **brief a team of AI agents**: one team lead and three builders who work **at the same time**. Then you check their work, ship it, and play it at your own link.

Nobody's game will look the same. Yours might be a seagull over San Luis Obispo at sunset. Your neighbor's might be a pigeon dodging skyscrapers in New York. Same game underneath, your version on top.

> **Missed the meeting?** Everything you need is on this page. Go top to bottom. Each step says how long it takes and what you should see.

**Finish line:** your game plays at your own live link, it looks, sounds and plays the way you chose, and your link is in the club portal.

> **Before you click anything, you need two things:**
> 1. A **GitHub account**
> 2. **Codex**, signed in with a **personal** email (not calpoly.edu)
>
> Missing either one? Do [Step 0](#step-0--before-you-start) first. In the room and not set up? Follow along on a neighbor's screen and build yours after the meeting.

## Stuck? Ask your AI first

**It knows your screen better than any officer does.** Your AI can see your exact situation: your laptop, your browser, your error. An officer walking by can't. So **whenever you don't know what to do, give this page to your AI and ask.** Use whatever you have: Codex, Claude Code, ChatGPT, even the ChatGPT app on your phone.

1. Copy the link to this page from your browser's address bar.
2. Take a screenshot of what you're stuck on, if you can. (Mac: **Cmd+Shift+4**. Windows: **Windows key+Shift+S**.)
3. Paste this into your AI, fill in the brackets, attach the screenshot, and send:

```text
I'm a beginner following this tutorial: [paste the link to this page]
Read the whole tutorial first.

I'm on Step [number]: [step name].
Here's what I see: [describe it, or paste the exact error message]
I'm using: [Mac or Windows], [Chrome, Safari or Edge], [Codex, Claude Code or ChatGPT]

Tell me exactly what to click or type next, one small step at a time.
Assume I've never used GitHub or coding tools before.
```

Already in a Codex chat that's connected to your repo? Even easier. Type: `Read README.md and docs/HELP.md in my repo. I'm stuck on Step [number]. Here's what I see: [...]. What do I do next?`

**Still stuck after asking your AI?** Then read [the help page](docs/HELP.md), then ask a neighbor, then ask an officer. Officers are for things AI can't fix: your account, permissions, and the portal.

---

## How today works

You're the **boss**. You give one set of instructions to a **team lead** agent (the orchestrator). The team lead splits the work into three jobs and hands each one to a **builder** agent (a subagent). All three builders work at the same time. **Each builder hands you its own part.** You evaluate each builder's work, then combine the three parts yourself, one at a time.

```
                         YOU  (the boss)
                          │  one prompt: your version of the game
                          ▼
                   ORCHESTRATOR  (the team lead)
                          │  plans three jobs, you type "go"
          ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
          ▼               ▼               ▼
     CORE builder     ART builder    SOUND builder     ← all three at the same time
     game.js          sprites.js     sounds.js
     config.js
          │               │               │
          ▼               ▼               ▼
     pull request 1  pull request 2  pull request 3   ← one per builder
          └───────────────┼───────────────┘
                          ▼
     YOU evaluate each one and combine them: merge Core, then Art, then Sound
```

**Why three builders?** For a game this small, one agent could do it all. We use three so you learn the move. On bigger work, like a 20-page website or research on 10 competitors, this is how you finish in a third of the time. The real skill isn't starting three agents. It's knowing **which jobs don't need each other**.

### Words you'll see

| Word | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| **Repo** (repository) | A folder of project files on GitHub. |
| **Template** | The club's starter repo. You make your own copy. You never change the club's copy. |
| **Live link** | Your game on the internet, like `https://your-name.github.io/clone-wars/`. It stays the same as your game changes. |
| **Orchestrator** | The team lead agent. It plans and starts the builders. |
| **Subagent** | A builder agent. It does one job, only touches its own files, and hands you its own pull request. |
| **Branch** | A separate copy of your files where a builder works without touching your real version (`main`). |
| **Pull request (PR)** | A builder saying "here's my part, want it?" |
| **Merge** | You saying "yes." That part goes into `main` and your live link updates. Merging all three is how you combine them. |
| **Answer key** | A working copy of the game's core, in case yours breaks. More in Step 5. |

## Step 0 · Before you start

**Do this before the meeting.** If you did Session 02, you're probably already set up. Check each line anyway.

> **In the room and not set up?** Sit next to a neighbor who is, and follow along on their screen. Then do Step 0 and build your own game after the meeting with this page.

1. **A GitHub account.** Sign up free at [github.com](https://github.com). Any email works.
2. **Codex with a personal email.** The Codex student offer needs a **personal** email (like Gmail).
   - Signing up with your `calpoly.edu` email fails without telling you why.
   - The school Codex account can't use the GitHub connector, so it won't work today.
   - Stuck on the offer page? Open a private window: **Cmd+Shift+N** on Mac (Chrome or Safari), **Ctrl+Shift+N** on Windows (Chrome, or Edge's InPrivate window). Go to the student offer, sign in there with your personal email, then come back to a normal window.
3. **Pick the cheap model.** In the model picker, choose **GPT-5.6 Luna**. If you don't see it, pick the cheapest, fastest model in the list. Bigger models burn through your usage fast, and today runs four agents.

**Stuck on any of this?** Codex isn't set up yet, so use ChatGPT (laptop or phone) with the [help prompt](#stuck-ask-your-ai-first). Tell it which step you're on and attach a screenshot.

✅ **You should see:** Codex open with your personal account and **GPT-5.6 Luna** selected. (You'll connect Codex to GitHub in Step 1, right after you make your repo.)

---

## Step 1 · Copy the template, connect Codex, go live, submit your link

⏱️ **About 9 minutes**

### 1a · Make your own copy

1. Open the club template: **https://github.com/KyleStefan/clone-wars-flappy-bird**
2. Click the green **Use this template** button, then **Create a new repository**.
3. Fill in:
   - **Owner:** your own account (your username)
   - **Repository name:** `clone-wars`. If you already have a repo with that name, use `clone-wars-2`.
   - **Public** (required for a free live link)
4. Click **Create repository**.

✅ **You should see:** a page at `github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/clone-wars` listing `README.md`, `CONTRACT.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `index.html`, a `docs` folder and a `tests` folder. You'll also see `.gitignore` and `.nojekyll`. Those two are normal. Ignore them.

⚠️ Look at the address bar. It must have **your** username in it, not `KyleStefan`. Last time, lots of people gave Codex the club's link by mistake.

### 1b · Give Codex access to this repo only

Codex only needs to see today's repo. Don't give it access to all your GitHub projects (class work, internship code, anything private).

**Never connected GitHub to Codex before:**
1. In Codex, find the **GitHub** connector (sometimes called a plugin or app) and click to connect it. <!-- CONFIRM after Kyle's test: exact place to find the GitHub connector in the Codex app members use. -->
2. Sign in to GitHub if it asks.
3. If it asks where to install, pick **your own account**.
4. Choose **Only select repositories**, pick **clone-wars**, and click **Install** (or **Save**).

**Already connected GitHub to Codex before (like in Session 02):**
1. On GitHub, click your profile picture → **Settings** → **Applications** (left sidebar) → **Installed GitHub Apps**.
2. Find the ChatGPT / Codex app and click **Configure**.
3. Under **Repository access**:
   - Set to **Only select repositories**? Click **Select repositories** and add **clone-wars**.
   - Set to **All repositories**? We recommend switching to **Only select repositories** and choosing **clone-wars**, plus any other repos you still use with Codex.
4. Click **Save**.

**Check that it worked.** In Codex, start a new chat, select **GPT-5.6 Luna**, and send this (with your username):

```text
Can you see my GitHub repo YOUR-USERNAME/clone-wars? Answer yes or no,
then list the files you see. Don't change anything.
```

✅ **You should see:** "yes," and a list that includes `README.md`, `CONTRACT.md`, `AGENTS.md` and `index.html`. Says no? See [Codex can't see my repo](docs/HELP.md#codex-setup).

### 1c · Turn on your live link

1. In **your** repo, click **Settings** (top bar, far right). On a small screen it may be hidden under a **⋯** menu at the end of that bar.
2. In the left sidebar, click **Pages**.
3. Under **Build and deployment → Source**, choose **Deploy from a branch**.
4. Under **Branch**, choose **main** and **/(root)**. Click **Save**.
5. Wait about a minute. Refresh the page. A box appears at the top: **"Your site is live at …"**. Click **Visit site**.

✅ **You should see:** a dark page that says **"Your starter is live."** with your live link and a **Copy link** button.

Seeing a **404** page? That's normal for the first minute or two. Wait, then refresh. Still 404 after 5 minutes? See [Pages shows 404](docs/HELP.md#pages-shows-404).

### 1d · Save both links

Open a note (Notes, Google Docs, anything) and paste both links into it. You'll need them again.

| Link | How to get it | What it's for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Repo link** | On GitHub, click your repo name (`clone-wars`) at the top of the page, then copy the address bar. It must look exactly like `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/clone-wars`, with **nothing after `clone-wars`**. If you copy it while you're on the Settings page, it ends in `/settings/pages`, which is wrong. | **Give this one to Codex.** |
| **Live link** | Copy it from the **Copy link** button on your starter page. It looks like `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/clone-wars/` | **Submit this one to the portal.** Share it with friends. |

### 1e · Submit your live link to the portal now

Your live link stays the same as you update this repo, so you submit it now, before you build. When you merge later, the same link shows your finished game.

1. Open **[calpolyvibecoding.com/portal](https://calpolyvibecoding.com/portal)** and log in (or sign up).
2. Open **Builds**.
3. Under **Post this week's build**, paste your **live link** into **Link**. The `github.io` one, not the repo link.
4. In **What is it?**, write: `Clone Wars (Session 03). Building now.`
5. Click **Post it**.

✅ **You should see:** your entry in the Builds list.

> ### 🛑 STOP 1 · Live and submitted
>
> Your starter page opens at your own `github.io` link, and that link is in the portal. Don't go on until both are true.

---

## Step 2 · Make it yours: write your prompt

⏱️ **About 4 minutes**

**Nothing goes into Codex yet.** In this step you write the instructions for your AI team in your note. You'll paste them into Codex in Step 3.

### 2a · Copy the prompt into your note

Click the **copy icon** (two squares) at the top right of the gray box below. Paste it into your **note** from Step 1d.

(Why a note and not Codex? In Codex, pressing Enter sends the message before you're done filling it in.)

```text
You are the orchestrator for my Clone Wars build. You lead a team of
three subagents.

My repo: [paste your REPO link, the github.com one]

My version:
- Title: [a name for your game]
- Looks like: [where it's set, what the obstacles are, and who you play as]
- Sounds like: [what the flap, score and crash sound like, or "whatever fits"]
- Plays differently: [Easy/Normal buttons, Easier first 3 obstacles, Checkpoints every 10 points, or your own idea]

Part 1. Plan, then stop.
Read AGENTS.md and CONTRACT.md in my repo. Change nothing yet.
Follow AGENTS.md Part A, Step 1: tell me the plan in plain words,
then stop and wait until I type go.

Part 2. When I type go.
Follow AGENTS.md Part A, Steps 2 to 4: start all three subagents at
the same time on gpt-5.6-luna, each on its own branch. Each subagent
opens its own pull request. Check their work, then give me the three
pull request links in merge order: Core, Art, Sound.
Do not merge anything, and do not combine them.
```

### 2b · Make it yours: how it looks, sounds and plays

You're taking a game that already exists and changing **three things** about it: **how it looks, how it sounds, and how it plays.** Each change goes to a different builder.

In your note, replace each **[square bracket]**, including the brackets themselves. Only these five lines change. Leave everything else exactly as it is.

| Line in the prompt | What to write | Built by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **My repo** | Your **repo link** from Step 1d. It ends in `/clone-wars`. | The team lead |
| **Title** | A name for your game, 30 characters max | Core |
| **Looks like** | Where it's set, what the obstacles are, and who you play as | Art |
| **Sounds like** | What the flap, score and crash sound like. Not sure? Write "whatever fits." | Sound |
| **Plays differently** | One change to how the game plays. Pick one from the list below, or write your own. | Core |

**Here's what the middle of a finished prompt looks like:**

```text
My repo: https://github.com/your-username/clone-wars

My version:
- Title: SLO Flap
- Looks like: San Luis Obispo at sunset, Bishop Peak in the back, palm trees as obstacles. I play as a seagull.
- Sounds like: a seagull squawk when I flap, a beach bell when I score, a splash when I crash
- Plays differently: Easy/Normal buttons
```

### Need ideas?

| Title | Looks like | Sounds like |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Galaxy Flap | a desert planet with two suns, laser gates as obstacles. I play as a small starfighter. | laser pews, a hyperspace whoosh, an explosion |
| SLO Flap | San Luis Obispo at sunset, palm trees as obstacles. I play as a seagull. | a squawk, a beach bell, a splash |
| Big Apple Dash | New York City at night, skyscrapers as obstacles. I play as a pigeon. | a coo, a subway ding, a car horn |
| Orbit | outer space, asteroids as obstacles. I play as a tiny rocket. | a thruster puff, a sparkle, a crunch |
| Farm Run | a Cal Poly farm field, hay bale stacks as obstacles. I play as a chicken. | a cluck, a cowbell, a thud |

Keep it simple: bold shapes and silhouettes draw well. Tiny details (a specific logo, a real person, your apartment's exact couch) don't.

**Inspired by a movie or show? Go for the vibe, not the brand.** "A desert planet with two suns" and "a small starfighter" are great. Named characters, famous ships, logos and theme songs aren't allowed. No real people either.

### Pick how it plays differently

| Write this | What changes |
| --- | --- |
| **Easy/Normal buttons** | Easy and Normal buttons on the start screen. Easy has bigger gaps and slower obstacles. |
| **Easier first 3 obstacles** | The first three obstacles have bigger gaps and move slower, so you don't crash right away. |
| **Checkpoints every 10 points** | After a crash, you start again from your last checkpoint (10, 20, 30...), not from zero. |
| **Your own idea** | Describe it in one sentence. The Core builder will try it. Your own ideas are riskier and aren't in the answer key. |

✅ **You should see:** the whole prompt in your note, with your repo link and your four answers filled in, and **no square brackets left**.

---

## Step 3 · Brief your team

⏱️ **About 3 minutes, including waiting for the plan**

### The one idea behind today (30-second read)

Three builders can work at the same time only if they **agree on names before they start**. The game will call `drawBird` to draw your character. The Art builder writes a `drawBird` that draws a seagull. The Core builder writes a game that calls `drawBird`. They never talk to each other. The shared names in `CONTRACT.md` are why their parts fit.

**What can't be split:** the crash check. Every moment, the game asks "is the bird touching a pipe?" That needs the bird **and** the pipes at the same time, so it stays with one builder (Core).

**Rule of thumb:** if two parts need each other every single moment, keep them together. If one only needs the other's name, split them.

### Send the prompt to Codex

1. In Codex, start a **new** chat with GitHub available. <!-- CONFIRM after Kyle's test: exact button to start a chat on your repo. -->
2. Make sure **GPT-5.6 Luna** is selected.
3. Copy your **finished prompt** from your note (everything, top to bottom).
4. Paste it into Codex and send it.

The team lead replies with a plan. **Before you type go, check four things:**

- [ ] **Three jobs:** Core (`game.js`, `config.js`), Art (`sprites.js`), Sound (`sounds.js`).
- [ ] **Your version is in it:** your title, how it looks, how it sounds, and how it plays differently.
- [ ] **It names the part that can't be split:** the crash check stays with Core.
- [ ] **You'll get three pull requests**, one per builder, to merge in order: Core, Art, Sound.

Something's off? Tell it what to change in plain words. Otherwise, **write down the time on your clock**, then type:

```text
go
```

✅ **You should see:** a plan with three jobs and your version in it. After you type **go**, a message saying it's starting the three jobs. The exact words vary, and that's fine.

---

## Step 4 · Watch your team build

⏱️ **About 5 to 10 minutes.** The agents do the work. You watch and learn.

While the builders work:

- **Look for three subagents running at the same time.** Depending on your Codex app, they show up as separate threads, a list of agents, or updates in the main chat. <!-- CONFIRM after Kyle's test: exactly where subagent threads appear. -->
- **Notice what each one is doing.** Core is writing the rules of the game. Art is drawing your world. Sound is making your beeps. None of them is waiting for the others.
- **Screenshot the three builders running.** Seeing them work at the same time is the best proof your team really ran in parallel.
- **Test yourself while you wait.** Without scrolling up: why can the Art builder work at the same time as the Core builder? And what's the one part that couldn't be split, and why? You'll write your answer in Step 6. (Stuck? Reread [the one idea](#the-one-idea-behind-today-30-second-read).)

> **Codex says you hit your usage limit?** Stop here. Nothing is lost: your live link is already in the portal. Watch a neighbor's build, then finish yours after the meeting. See [I ran out of usage](docs/HELP.md#i-ran-out-of-usage).
>
> **Following along on a neighbor's screen?** Ask them to show you their plan, their subagents and their three pull requests. Start your own after the meeting with this page.

When all three builders finish, the team lead sends you a summary: **three pull request links** (Core, Art, Sound) and when it says each builder started and finished.

**Did they really work at the same time? Check the evidence, not just the claim.** The team lead writes its own start times, so treat those as a claim. Here's evidence you can check yourself:

1. **What you saw.** Did you watch three builders working at once? That's the best proof.
2. **GitHub's own times.** On your repo, click **Pull requests**. Under each one it says "opened … minutes ago." Hover over that to see the exact time. GitHub records these, so the agents can't change them.
   - **At the same time:** the three pull requests opened close together, often not in Core, Art, Sound order. (The smallest job, usually Sound, tends to finish first.)
   - **One after another:** Core opened first, then Art several minutes later, then Sound several minutes after that.
3. **The summary itself.** If it says **one after another**, subagents weren't available in your Codex app. You still get three parts to evaluate, it just took longer.

Checking a claim against evidence is part of the job.

- Missing a link? Open your repo on GitHub and click **Pull requests**. You should see `Core: [your title]`, `Art: [your title]` and `Sound: [your title]`. Still missing one? See [I don't have a pull request](docs/HELP.md#i-dont-have-a-pull-request).

✅ **You should see:** three pull requests, one per builder, none merged yet.

---

## Step 5 · Evaluate each builder, then combine

⏱️ **About 12 minutes**

You're the boss now. Each builder hands you its part. You check it, and if it's good, you merge it into your game. You do this **three times, in order: Core, then Art, then Sound.** Your game assembles on your live link as you go.

### How to evaluate a builder

For each builder's pull request, answer three questions. You don't need to read any code.

| Question | How to check |
| --- | --- |
| **1. Did it stay in its lane?** | **Before merging**, click the **Files changed** tab. It should show **only** that builder's files. |
| **2. Did it follow your version?** | Read the pull request description. Does it match the line you gave that builder: **Looks like** for Art, **Sounds like** for Sound, **Title** and **Plays differently** for Core? |
| **3. Does its part work?** | **After merging**, check your live link using that builder's check below. |

**How to merge and check**, every time:
1. On the pull request's **Conversation** tab, click **Merge pull request**, then **Confirm merge**. You'll see a purple **Merged** badge.
2. Click your repo's **Actions** tab. Wait for the newest run to show a **green check** (about 1 to 2 minutes). A yellow dot means it's still running.
3. Open your **live link** and do a **hard refresh**: **Cmd+Shift+R** on Mac, **Ctrl+Shift+R** on Windows. A normal refresh can keep showing the old page for a few minutes.

**Watch the yellow label at the bottom of the game.** It lists the parts that haven't been merged yet, and it shrinks as you combine them. When it's gone, your game is complete.

**A builder fails a question?** Send it back. Only that builder redoes its part. See [Send a builder back](#send-a-builder-back) below.

---

### 5a · Builder 1: Core

Core builds the rules of the game, your title, and **how it plays differently**. Merge it first, because the other two parts plug into it.

1. Open the pull request **Core: [your title]**.
2. **Files changed** should show only `config.js` and `game.js`.
3. Read the description. Does it match your **Title** and **Plays differently** lines?
4. Merge it, wait for Actions, and hard refresh your live link.

**Check Core's work:**
- [ ] Your title shows on the start screen.
- [ ] Space, click or tap starts the game and flaps.
- [ ] Obstacles come at you, and you score by passing them.
- [ ] Hitting an obstacle or the ground ends the game and shows your score. You can play again.
- [ ] It plays differently the way you asked:
  - **Easy/Normal buttons:** **Easy** and **Normal** buttons on the start screen. Easy has bigger gaps.
  - **Easier first 3 obstacles:** the first three gaps are clearly bigger than the ones after.
  - **Checkpoints every 10 points:** reach 10 points, crash, and Game over says "Next game starts at checkpoint 10." Can't reach 10 in a couple of tries? Skip this box.
  - **Your own idea:** check whatever you asked for.

✅ **You should see:** a working game made of **plain boxes, with no sound**, and a yellow label: `placeholder: art, sound missing`. That's correct. Art and Sound aren't merged yet.

### 5b · Builder 2: Art

Art builds **how it looks**: the background, the obstacles and your character.

1. Open the pull request **Art: [your title]**.
2. **Files changed** should show only `sprites.js`.
3. Read the description. Does it match your **Looks like** line?
4. Merge it, wait for Actions, and hard refresh your live link.

**Check Art's work:**
- [ ] The background is the place you wrote.
- [ ] The obstacles are what you wrote (or fit your world, if you didn't say).
- [ ] You play as the character you wrote.
- [ ] You can **clearly see** your character and the obstacles against the background. Play one round to be sure.

✅ **You should see:** the same game, now in your world. The yellow label says `placeholder: sound missing`.

### 5c · Builder 3: Sound

Sound builds **how it sounds**: the flap, score and crash sounds.

1. Open the pull request **Sound: [your title]**.
2. **Files changed** should show only `sounds.js`.
3. Read the description. Does it match your **Sounds like** line?
4. Merge it, wait for Actions, and hard refresh your live link.

**Check Sound's work:** turn your volume up, click or press Space, and play.
- [ ] You hear a sound when you flap, and it's close to what you asked for.
- [ ] You hear a sound when you score, and it's close to what you asked for.
- [ ] You hear a sound when you crash, and it's close to what you asked for.
- [ ] **M** turns sound off and on.

✅ **You should see:** your complete game. **The yellow label is gone.** You just combined three builders' work into one game.

---

### Send a builder back

If a builder fails any check, type this in the same chat. Use `core`, `art` or `sound`, and say exactly what you saw:

```text
fix art: I can't see the laser gates against the dark sky.
```

```text
fix core: the start screen shows, but pressing Space does nothing.
```

The team lead sends only that builder back to fix its own part.
- **If you haven't merged that builder yet,** its pull request updates. Check it again.
- **If you already merged it,** you get a new pull request called **Fix [Core / Art / Sound]: ...**. Check its **Files changed** (only that builder's files), merge it, wait for Actions, and hard refresh.

**Each builder gets one fix try.**

### Core still broken? Use the answer key

The club has a working copy of `game.js`, the core of the game. It follows the same plan as yours, so your title, how it looks, how it sounds, and how it plays (if you picked from the list) still plug in. In the same chat, type:

```text
use the answer key
```

Open the new pull request **Use the answer key**. **Files changed** should show `game.js`, and maybe `config.js`. Nothing else. Merge it, wait for Actions, hard refresh, and keep going with Art and Sound.

> Using the answer key isn't cheating. Real engineers use a working reference all the time. The skill was **noticing** a builder's work was broken and **deciding** what to do.

Can't get the agent to swap it? See [Use the answer key by hand](docs/HELP.md#use-the-answer-key-by-hand).

Art or Sound still broken after its one fix? Keep going. Your game still plays. Tell an officer after the meeting.

> ### 🛑 STOP 2 · Combined and playable
>
> All three builders are merged. Your game plays at your own live link, and it looks, sounds and plays the way you chose.

---

## Step 6 · Update your portal entry

⏱️ **About 3 minutes**

1. Open **[calpolyvibecoding.com/portal](https://calpolyvibecoding.com/portal)** and go to **Builds**.
2. Find your Clone Wars entry and edit it. <!-- CONFIRM: exact name of the edit button in the portal. -->
3. Replace **What is it?** with one line in this shape:

```text
[Your title]: I cloned Flappy Bird and made it mine. It looks like [...], sounds like [...], and plays differently: [...]. The part that couldn't be split was [your answer, in your own words].

   For example:

   > SLO Flap: I cloned Flappy Bird and made it mine. It looks like San Luis Obispo at sunset with a seagull, sounds like a beach, and plays differently: Easy/Normal buttons. The part that couldn't be split was the crash check, because it has to know where the bird and the pipes are at the same moment.

4. Save.

## What you practiced

| Track | What you did today |
| --- | --- |
| **Orchestration** | You directed a team lead and three builders working at the same time, then combined their work yourself, one part at a time. |
| **Context** | One written plan (`CONTRACT.md`) let agents that never talked to each other build parts that fit. |
| **Judgment** | You checked the plan before "go", evaluated each builder on its own (right files, your version, working part), sent back any that failed, and decided whether to use the answer key. |
| **Evidence** | A live link anyone can play, and one line explaining what couldn't be split. |
| **Capability** | Agents that read your repo, write files, and open pull requests for you. |

**The Loop:** spec → build → test → deploy → iterate.

The finished game is plain HTML and JavaScript. No AI runs when someone plays it. AI helped you **build** it.

## Keep going (after the meeting)

- **Change how it plays again.** Start a new chat, point it at your repo, and describe a new twist. Ask it to follow `CONTRACT.md` and open a pull request.
- **Push your art further.** Ask for more detail in `sprites.js`: a moving skyline, day turning into night.

## Build your own clone (after you finish)

Want to clone something other than Flappy Bird? Use the same method on your own.

**Before you start:**
- **This isn't supported during the meeting.** There's no answer key, and officers can't help with it. Finish your Flappy Bird first.
- **Keep it to one screen and one thing to do.** A Wordle board, a Snake game, one Duolingo lesson. Not "all of Spotify."
- Same rules as today: plain HTML and JavaScript, no web addresses, no API keys, no brands.

**1. Make a new repo.** On GitHub, click **+** (top right) → **New repository**. Name it (like `my-clone`), choose **Public**, check **Add a README file**, and click **Create repository**. Then give Codex access to that repo only, the same way as [Step 1b](#1b--give-codex-access-to-this-repo-only).

**2. Brief a new team.** Start a new Codex chat on **GPT-5.6 Luna**. Fill in the brackets in your note first, then paste:

```text
You are the orchestrator for a new clone. You lead three subagents.
My repo: [paste the new repo link]

I want to clone: [one screen of an app or game, like "a Wordle board"]
Looks like: [how you want it to look]
Sounds like: [how you want it to sound, or "whatever fits"]
Plays differently: [one change to how it works]

Part 1. Plan, then stop.
Split this into exactly three jobs that can run at the same time.
Give each job its own files. Draft a CONTRACT.md: the exact names the
three parts share, and the one part that can't be split, and why.
Show me the plan and wait until I type go.

Part 2. When I type go.
First, open a pull request with only CONTRACT.md and an index.html
that loads every file. Wait until I tell you I merged it.
Then start all three subagents at the same time on gpt-5.6-luna, one
per job, each on its own branch. Each reads CONTRACT.md, touches only
its own files, and opens its own pull request saying what it built and
when it started and finished. Plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript only: no
frameworks, no web addresses, no API keys, no logos or brands.
Give me the three pull request links and the order to merge them.
Do not merge anything.
```

**3. Check the plan before you type go.** It's the same skill as today:
- [ ] Three jobs, and each one has **different files**.
- [ ] The names they share are written down.
- [ ] It names the part that can't be split.
- [ ] **The real test:** does any job need another job's *code* to exist first, not just its *names*? If yes, those jobs aren't really parallel. Tell it: "Job [X] depends on job [Y]. Re-split so the three jobs only share names."

**4. Go live, then evaluate and combine.** Merge the plan pull request first. Turn on Pages (**Settings → Pages → Deploy from a branch → main → /(root) → Save**). Then evaluate each builder's pull request the same way you did in Step 5, and merge them one at a time in the order the team lead gave you.
